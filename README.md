# The Fundamental Growth Plan (FGP)
Repository that holds code examples for all the data structures, algorithms, and CLRS problems reviewed within the FGP at http://www.morgan-howell.com/blog


I'm kicking off a regimen I've coined The Fundamental Growth Plan. FGP will potentially embrace a community of people that support one another to become more competitive in the tech-industry. FGP is a ruthless curriculum that can be seen as a "sprint of the final collegiate lap" for those interested in getting into some of the most competitive jobs in the US. It works off the balance of four main pillars: 1. Healthy mind healthy body 2. Interview preparation 3. General computational theory 4. CLRS review and problem solving. Each pillar will take up an equal amount of time in every participant's week, which will require participants to wake up at 5am and contribute to repos demonstrating commitment to solving a wide-range of programming problems. With weekly mock interviews, FGP aims to quantitatively track your progress towards having a deep understanding of computational theory applicable during an interview.
